# 2022-J.B.-Hunt-Hackathon

Hey there!!
This project is sort of a work in progress as it was constructed during a 24 hr hackathon which happened to be my first one.
The Razbot file is one half of the project we worked on the other half will unfortunately not work because I had to remove some things to make it open source and prevent it from being used maliciously.
Some things to note is that from the testing our group did this email sender will only work with google accounts. The CS file will need some tweeks if you want to use it for any applications but it is designed to scrape through a JSON data from a website.

                                           ----- Trouble shooting tips ------
Check and makesure that your Access for less secure apps setting has been turned on / enabled depending on the wording
There is also a page somewhere to reset your captcha if you see that the debug comment returns login on your computer
