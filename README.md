# 2022-J.B.-Hunt-Hackathon
Code from the 2022 J.B. Hunt Hackathon
Hey there!!
This project is sort of a work in progress as it was constructed during a 24 hr hackathon which happened to be my first one.
The Razbot file is one half of the project we worked on the other half will unfortunately not be open sourced :(
Some things to note is that from the testing our group did this email sender will only work with google accounts.
